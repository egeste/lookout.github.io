Yet another great week of open source hacking here [at
Lookout](https://github.com/lookout), and fortunately another week where we've
open sourced more projects!


A while back we [introduced FactoryJS](/2014/03/factoryjs/), in the same vein
of work we've now open sourced
[Oraculum](https://github.com/lookout/oraculum), a set of
Factory-driven Backbone.js behaviors based on Chaplin.

From the README:

> *Though a large portion of Oraculum's behavior is inherited from Chaplin,
> Oraculum employs a signficiantly different strategy surrounding the issues of
> inheritance, structure, and coupling. Applications built with Oraculum take
> full advantage of the aspect-oriented programming and composition paradigms
> offered by [FactoryJS](https://github.com/lookout/factoryjs). The purpose of this project is to collect abstract,
> reusable behaviors into a framework that can be used by anyone building
> complex applications with Backbone.*



We also open sourced
[Spongebob](https://github.com/lookout/spongebob), a tool to diff
[nmap](http://nmap.org) runs.



[Last week](/2014/06/weekly-rollup-in-opensource-25/) we mentioned that
[ngx_borderpatrol](https://github.com/lookout/ngx_borderpatrol) was in the
process of learning how to talk to [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd).
After a solid round of discussion and review on [this pull
request](https://github.com/lookout/ngx_borderpatrol/pull/13), support for
statsd tracking of login successes and failures has been merged.
