Regular readers might have the impression that
[Lookout](https://github.com/lookout) uses JRuby quite a bit. Turns out we do!

As big fans of JRuby we've also submitted a talk to [this year's JRubyConf
EU](http://2014.jrubyconf.eu/) to discuss some of our most recent work with
JRuby, [Storm](https://storm.incubator.apache.org/) and
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).



Our talk is titled: **Building a scalable messaging fabric with JRuby and
Storm** and will be given by [R. Tyler Croy](https://github.com/rtyler) and
[Ian Smith](https://github.com/ismith).

The abstract is as follows:

> As Lookout has grown the number of backend Ruby services the need for
> reliable, asynchronous service-to-service messaging has gone from "nice to
> have" to "absolute requirement."
>
> Our first attempts included some names you may be familiar with: [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/),
> [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), [Redis](http://redis.io), and
> [Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/). As our infrastructure grew, we found we were
> reinventing many of the concepts "Storm," an open source real-time
> computation/stream-processing system, was specifically designed to handle such
> as message routing, durability, streaming from multiple inputs, delivering to
> multiple outputs, etc.
>
> In this talk we'll cover how we built a scalable service-to-service messaging
> fabric on top of Storm and Kafka, with [JRuby](http://jruby.org) playing a starring role.


JRubyConf EU will be held as part of [Eurucamp](http://2014.eurucamp.org) on
**August 1st** in Potsdam, southwest of Berlin. Please join us to talk about
Ruby, JRuby, Lookout, mobile security and scalable systems!
