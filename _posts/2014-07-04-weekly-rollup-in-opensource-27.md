With the July 4th holiday occurring this week, [Lookout
engineering](https://twitter.com/lookouteng) was running at lowered capacity as
many of us decided to take some much needed time off. Regardless, we still had
a decent amount of activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/lookout).


The majority of the open source work this week was focused on two repositories,
[Oraculum](https://github.com/lookout/oraculum) which we discussed [last
week](/2014/06/weekly-rollup-in-opensource-26/) and [Elementary
RPC](https://github.com/lookout/elementary-rpc).

While Oraculum didn't gain much more code or functionality this past week, it
gained [more
documentation](http://hackers.lookout.com/oraculum/README.md.html), which is
arguably more important for a new project like Oraculum.


Elementary is a Ruby gem that aims to provide a "*simple, async client library for
interacting with Protobuf RPC servers*." This week version 1.0.0 was
released to [Rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/elementary-rpc). You can
learn more about how to use the gem from the project's
[README](https://github.com/lookout/elementary-rpc#sample-usage).



The raw numbers for the week:

 * 8 git pushes
 * 6 pull requests created
 * 1 issues created
 * 2 repositories forked
